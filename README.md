QuestEngine
===========

This is a simple flash engine for creating simple graphic quests.

You can manage the game's structure via quest.xml file.

"Condition" tag:
Now it understands only few base conditions and do not parse 
brackets. Besides I am sure there are a few bugs with it. 
But I'm working on it.

Not private variables:
I've heard that in AS3 public variables are the same as set+get
construction (without any extra logic in it), if you know any reasons
to not allow public vars in AS3 please let me know, I will immediately 
change all of them.
